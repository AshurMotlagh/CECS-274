                                        11  ->  45  ->  989
if there are 900 items in the list we have to go through every single one of them
n items -> n trys find or exhast (linked list)

                                                45
                                       11                989
if there are 900 items in the tree, will you go over evry single one of them? NO
n items (tree)  log2(n)

150,000,000 items
linked list -> 150,000,000
BST -> 28 (log2(150,000,000))

150,000,000 items (search)
linked list -> growth rate of n
BST -> growth rate log(n)

150,000,000 items (search)
linked list -> Big O(n)
BST -> O(log(n))


Sorts (algorithm)
Bubble sort  O(n^2)
quick sort   O(n*log(n))
merge sort
heap sort
bogo sort
insertion sort
comb sort
shaker sort
selection sort
BST


Bubble Sort
The largest number goes to the end while the smallest will be at the top
done by going top to bottom comparing largest number and taking it down to the bottom
